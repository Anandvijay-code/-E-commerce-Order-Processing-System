4. E-commerce Order Processing System
------------------------------------------
Description: Build a system to handle order processing, track shipments, and manage customer data. Key Features:

Complex joins and subqueries.
Triggers for order status updates.
Stored procedures for order processing.
Performance tuning for large datasets.



Creating an E-commerce Order Processing System using Oracle involves several key components. Here's a detailed breakdown of how you can implement this project, focusing on the key features you mentioned:

  1. Complex Joins and Subqueries

**Example**: Retrieve order details along with customer information and shipment status.

  
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.customer_name, s.shipment_status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shipments s ON o.order_id = s.order_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN TO_DATE('2024-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_DATE('2024-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
  

  2. Triggers for Order Status Updates

**Example**: Create a trigger to update the order status when a shipment is dispatched.

  
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_update_order_status
AFTER INSERT ON shipments
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE orders
  SET order_status = 'Shipped'
  WHERE order_id = :NEW.order_id;
END;
  

  3. Stored Procedures for Order Processing

**Example**: Stored procedure to process a new order.

  
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE process_order (
  p_order_id IN NUMBER,
  p_customer_id IN NUMBER,
  p_order_date IN DATE,
  p_total_amount IN NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount, order_status)
  VALUES (p_order_id, p_customer_id, p_order_date, p_total_amount, 'Processing');

  -- Additional logic for inventory update, payment processing, etc.
  
  COMMIT;
END;
  

  4. Performance Tuning for Large Datasets

**Example**: Using indexes and partitioning to improve query performance.

**Creating Indexes**:
  
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_shipments_order_id ON shipments(order_id);
  

**Partitioning Tables**:
  
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id NUMBER,
  customer_id NUMBER,
  order_date DATE,
  total_amount NUMBER,
  order_status VARCHAR2(20)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date) (
  PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2024-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')),
  PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2025-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
);
  

  Additional Considerations

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure referential integrity using foreign keys.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your PL/SQL procedures.
- **Security**: Use roles and privileges to secure sensitive data.

  Example Schema

**Customers Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR2(100),
  email VARCHAR2(100),
  phone VARCHAR2(15)
);
  

**Orders Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id NUMBER,
  order_date DATE,
  total_amount NUMBER,
  order_status VARCHAR2(20),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
  

**Shipments Table**:
  
CREATE TABLE shipments (
  shipment_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id NUMBER,
  shipment_date DATE,
  shipment_status VARCHAR2(20),
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);
  

This project will demonstrate your ability to handle complex SQL queries, use PL/SQL for business logic, and optimize performance for large datasets. Let me know if you need further details or assistance with any specific part of the project!
